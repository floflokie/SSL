        "\n",
        "In this practical assignment, we explore the concepts of **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** by implementing and training a convolutional VAE on the MNIST dataset. The primary objectives are to learn how VAEs encode data into a structured latent space and to investigate how this latent space can be leveraged for generating new data and understanding data features.\n",

        "### Key Learning Goals:\n",
        "1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the MNIST dataset and prepare it for training a convolutional neural network.\n",
        "2. **VAE Architecture**: Define a VAE model with convolutional layers for encoding and decoding images, including a reparameterization trick to ensure smooth sampling from the latent space.\n",
        "3. **VAE Loss Function**: Understand and implement the VAE loss, which combines reconstruction loss and KL-divergence to balance accurate reconstructions with a regularized latent space.\n",
        "4. **Model Training**: Train the VAE model on MNIST, observe loss trends, and understand the impact of balancing reconstruction quality and latent space regularization.\n",
        "5. **Latent Space Visualization**: Perform latent space interpolation by linearly blending between two points in the latent space, generating smooth transitions between two digit classes."

        "In this section, we define the architecture of a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** with convolutional layers, designed to process the MNIST dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Code Breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization and Latent Dimension**:\n",
        "   - `latent_dim=2` is defined as the dimensionality of the latent space. Setting it to a low number (e.g., 2) makes the latent space easy to visualize.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Encoder**:\n",
        "   - The encoder consists of three convolutional layers:\n",
        "     - The first layer transforms the input image of size 1x28x28 to a feature map of size 32x14x14.\n",
        "     - The second layer further reduces it to a size of 64x7x7.\n",
        "     - The third layer compresses this to a size of 128x1x1.\n",
        "   - This results in a flattened feature vector, which is then fed into two fully connected layers (`fc_mu` and `fc_logvar`) to produce the **mean** (`mu`) and **log-variance** (`logvar`) of the latent space.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Reparameterization Trick**:\n",
        "   - In `reparameterize`, we use the mean and log-variance vectors to sample from a Gaussian distribution. This is done by computing:\n",
        "\n",
        "     z = \\mu + \\sigma \\cdot \\epsilon\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Here, `epsilon` is a random noise sampled from a standard normal distribution. This allows gradients to backpropagate through the sampling process.\n",

        "   - The decoder starts with a fully connected layer to expand the latent vector (`z`) back to a shape compatible with the convolutional layers.\n",
        "   - It then passes through three transposed convolutional layers to reconstruct the original image shape:\n",
        "     - The first layer reshapes it to 64x7x7.\n",
        "     - The second layer outputs 32x14x14.\n",
        "     - The final layer produces the original shape, 1x28x28, with pixel values normalized between 0 and 1 using a Sigmoid activation.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Forward Pass**:\n",
        "   - `encode`: Passes the input through the encoder to obtain `mu` and `logvar`.\n",
        "   - `reparameterize`: Samples from the latent distribution using `mu` and `logvar`.\n",
        "   - `decode`: Reconstructs the image from the latent vector `z`.\n",
